# Introduction

> The base content for this Gitbook comes from "Introduction to the Yocto Project: A hands-on approach" by Yocto Mexico Team presented by Leo @ Intel Internal Presentation.
>
> It's not an embedded Linux distribution â€“ it creates a custom one for you. The Yocto Project is an open source collaboration project that provides templates, tools and methods to help you create custom Linux-based systems for embedded products regardless of the hardware architecture.

## Build Systems, Buildroot

> Buildroot is a simple, efficient and easy-to-use tool to generate embedded Linux systems through cross-compilation. [Buildroot](https://buildroot.org/)

## Embedded Systems

> An embedded system is a computer system with a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electrical system, often with real-time computing constraints. It is embedded as part of a complete device often including hardware and mechanical parts. Embedded systems control many devices in common use today.
